PAA2020 Poster Session Gendered Time and Family Formation in Great Britain

This is a poster file related to the **PAA 2020 virtual meeting** ([poster library](https://engage.populationassociation.org/paa-2020/posters)) about my work on the Gendered time use pattern (paid work time and housework time) when people get married, stay married, become parents, and grow up with their children together. My poster is in Session: P3 P3 - Marriage, Family, Households, and Unions.

Data used for this paper is the [UKHLS dataset](https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/). Please refer to my repository [ukhls_cleanpool](https://github.com/jomuzhi/ukhls_cleanpool) about how to clean this widely used, high-quality dataset. 

The uploaded file is the RMarkdown file and related materials used in producing the poster file in html format.

For detailed info about how to create a poster using RMarkdown, please refer to [posterdown_betterland](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown/wiki/posterdown_betterland) by [Brent Thorne](https://github.com/brentthorne).

I will update the related paper and replication materials if the paper is published. Fingers crossed.

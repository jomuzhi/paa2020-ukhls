## Poster Paper Info :sparkles:
Poster in PDF file uploaded to PAA2020 Poster Session Gendered Time and Family Formation in Great Britain.

This is a poster file related to the **PAA 2020 virtual meeting** ([poster library](https://engage.populationassociation.org/paa-2020/posters)) about my work on the *Gendered time use pattern (paid work time and housework time) when people get married, stay married, become parents, and grow up with their children together*. My poster is in **Session: P3 P3 - Marriage, Family, Households, and Unions**.

Data used for this paper is the [UKHLS dataset](https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/). Please refer to my repository [ukhls_cleanpool](https://github.com/jomuzhi/ukhls_cleanpool) about how to clean this widely used, high-quality dataset. 

I will update the related paper and replication materials if the paper is published. Fingers crossed. :pray:
